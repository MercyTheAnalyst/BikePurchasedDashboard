# BikePurchasedDashboard

This project explains data cleaning and visualization of bike buyers dataset. 

The data provided features such as marital status, gender, income, children, education, age, distance commute and purchase bike												
among others.  												
												
I performed data analysis on the datasets as shown in the Working Sheet section. This I did by removing the missing data. 												
Also, I performed Age Bracket on the Age column, this helped to put the Age in a categorical format which in turns aid vizualization.												
The Adolescent Age is below 30, the Middle Age ranges from 31 to 54 and the Old Age ranges from 55 and above.												
												
The 10+ miles under the Commute Distance column was readjusted to 10 Miles Above, to help the sorting of the table under the												
pivot table. 												
												
The Gender, Income and Purchased Bike columns were used for the first pivot table and vizualized using Bar Chart. The chart shows												
that the average income of Female that do not purchase bike is $55,313 and $58,862 did purchase bike; while for Male $58,585 did 												
not purchase  bike and $60,769 did purchase. The result shows that in both cases Male made more money than the Female.												
												
The second pivot table showed the Commute Distnce and the Count of Purchased Bike. A Line Plot was used to visualized the 												
relationship between these factors. From the table and the plot, it was observed that The Number of Count for those that												
Purchased Bike and those who didn't purchase are high (98 & 94) for short distance of 0 -1 Miles. These however, dropped drastically for 												
those who purchased bike for long distance such as 10 Miles Above (13) when compared to those who do not purchased bike (50). The  												
reason could be the fact that for longer distances, people tend to purchase other means of transportation such as cars or perhaps,												
 leverage on public transport.												
												
												
The third pivot table showed the relationship between the Age Bracket and the Count of Purchased Bike. A Line Plot was 												
used to aid the visualization. It was showed that people in the Middle Age bracket have the highest count that both purchased 												
bike and also that didn't purchased bike (178 & 178). People in the Adolescent Bracket didn't purchase bike as such and also 												
people in the Old Age bracket. This is reasonable because people with Middle Age are those who go with daily activities in												
earning for living. 												
												
The Dashboard was thus, built bringing the third charts together. Slicers was then included to intently see the behavior of 												
the charts as affected by different variables such as the marital status, region and education among others.												
When hovering the Marital status for instance the Married, and Europe was selected under Region as well as Bachelors for 												
Education; the behavior of the charts could be seen that the average income of the Married Male that didn't purchased bike 												
is $40,000 while it was $35,294 for those that purchased; and $39,325 for Married Female didn't purchased and $40,000 did.												
It can thus be seen the behavior with the Distance Commute and the Age Bracket Charts.												
												
												
The dashboard ould be manouver to derive more insights on how one factor aaffects the other on whether bike was purchased												
or not.
